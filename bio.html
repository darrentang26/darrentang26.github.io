	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Darren Tang, and I'm a first-year at Tufts University as a prospective Computer Science major.<br />
	Hailing from Worcester, Massachusetts, I am a local who is quite familiar with the winter conditons of the northeast.<br />
	My passion for coding and computers isn't shown through the three years I've worked at a local pizza shop, but the<br />
	two years of robotics that my high school offered definitely do. As such, I am active in the robotics club at this university too.</p>
	<p>こにちはみなさん。僕の名前なんでもないです。僕は大学生。僕は中国人です。あなたは僕の友達ありません。</p>
